Website is made using HTML,CSS3 and Bootstrap as Framework
Started with the logo of the website and then the navigation bar. I have used container class also.
Coming to the body part I have included images and also I have created links by clicking on the images. I have given basic animation too to the images by hovering over the images
Footer part of the website contains social media icons and details for contact. 
While doing this project I learnt how to make social media icons, how to give animation to images and got a good amount of experience while doing this project and I also know how to use media queries as I have learnt during the learning course. Currently learning javascript along
It took around 4-6 hrs to create this website as it was my first website 
To run the code: One can use sublime text using browser sync 
One can also run code in GitHub-pages:Go to settings> Github-pages(Activate GitHub-pages by selecting branch)>A link will appear click on it(https://vhd12.github.io/nick-fury/ )>>then write ahead, the directory where code is placed and filename.html(https://vhd12.github.io/nick-fury/WebPlce/places.html)
